# A Simple and primitive MediaWiki Bot
---
A simple python discord bot for directing users to pages on a predefined MediaWiki server
Designed for use with Linux and I cant be bothered to see how I could make it work with windows
--------
# Usage

Simply Create two files, one named TOKEN.txt (this is where you put your discord bot token in, no spaces or fluff around it) 
and WIKI_URL.txt, where you put the wiki url in (should be in the form "https://<wiki_name>.wiki.<whatever>" )
 
To Start the bot, run start.sh, use the flag -u for updating the list of pages stored in pages.json
  
I could probably update this but I don't even use it myself so why bother.
